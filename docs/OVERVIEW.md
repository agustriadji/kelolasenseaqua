# ðŸŒŠ Project Overview â€“ KelolaSenseAqua

**KelolaSenseAqua** is a modular and scalable IoT platform designed to monitor and control water quality for multiple sectors including aquaculture, hydroponics, agriculture, and pollution monitoring.

The system emphasizes:

- Plug-and-play modular sensors (wired and wireless)
- Efficient power distribution and protection
- Remote monitoring & control via mobile/web
- Cost-efficiency and DIY-friendly deployment

---

## ðŸ’¡ Background & Problem

Conventional water monitoring systems tend to be:

- Expensive and rigid (non-modular)
- Difficult to repair (single point of failure)
- Non-flexible for varied use-cases
- Lacking real-time analytics and remote control

These limitations make it difficult for hobbyists, small farmers, and communities to adopt intelligent water management tools.

## ðŸ§© Modular System Design

The system consists of the following modular components:

1. **Power Control Unit (PCU)**

   - AC input, relay isolation, and protection circuit
   - Microcontroller for safety logic and socket-level monitoring

2. **Sensor Module**

   - Supports both wired and wireless sensors
   - Communicates via Serial/NRF, and relays data to ESP32

3. **Smart Control Socket**

   - ESP32 board for remote access and MQTT integration

4. **Lighting Module**

   - Plugable LED emitter groups
   - Panel relay control, active ventilation

5. **Feeding Module**

   - Stepper/motor-based feeding with scheduled triggers

6. **Fan Control Module**

   - Parallel fan socket with power limit

7. **Wireless Modular Sensors**
   - NRF communication
   - EEPROM for ID, type, and location metadata

## ðŸŽ¯ Target MVP Use Cases

The system is designed to scale. However, the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) targets small-to-medium use cases such as:

- Aquarium & aquascape automation
- Small hydroponic setups
- Environmental monitoring in remote areas
- Early warning systems for fish cages (wireless sensor nodes)
